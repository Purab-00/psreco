    <p class="mb-2"><strong>Purab</strong></p>
    <p class="mb-4">Hi! I'm Purab, a 10th standard student passionate about technology and building real-world solutions. I love working with Python and Flutter, and enjoy learning new frameworks and tools to solve interesting problems.</p>
    <p class="mb-4">This project, Parking Spot Recommender (PS Reco), was created as part of a hackathon challenge. My goal is to make parking smarter and more efficient for everyone, using modern web technologies and a user-friendly design. I believe that even as a student, it's possible to build impactful applications that address everyday challenges.</p>
    <p class="mb-4">I'm always eager to learn, collaborate, and innovate. Thank you for checking out PS Reco!</p>
